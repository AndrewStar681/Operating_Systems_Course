# Lab-08

## EX2
- used method for limitin the tiome of program's work 
- used "vmstat 1 14" instead "vmstat 1"

## EX4
    I separated the usage of memory at the start of the program
    from the each time when we checked it
    that's why I have two numbers: at the beginning of the program + till the check

## EX5
    Am i right or there is something that can be more clear?

## EX6

    16-bit virtual addresses: Is it 2^16 bits or bytes?
    Just I remember from th lab it is bits, but it seems like fault in my mind.

## Have a good day!!!
