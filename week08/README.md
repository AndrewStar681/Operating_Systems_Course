# Lab-08

## EX2
- used method for limiting the time of the program's work 
- used "vmstat 1 14" instead "vmstat 1"

## EX4

I separated the usage of memory at the start of the program
from the each time when we checked it
that's why I have two numbers: at the beginning of the program + till the check

## EX5

Am i right or there is something that can be more clear?

## EX6

16-bit virtual addresses: It is 2^16 bits or bytes?
Just I remember from the lab it is bits, but it seems like fault in my mind.

## Have a good day!!!
