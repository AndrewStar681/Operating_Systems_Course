# LAB12 (Week12)

I used wsl instead of virtual machine, so I could not to run my programs, and I hope they will work if you run them.
They will create respective files: ex2.txt and ex3.txt

### ex1:
- because of wsl it is oly part of whole data from /proc/ioports
### ex2 and ex3:
- if you can, run it please
