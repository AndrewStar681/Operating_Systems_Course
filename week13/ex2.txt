#1

I think that PREVENTION may be the first step in 
limited resources'environment

#2

If we have a lot of resources, we can try AVOIDANCE
just to identify if there is a cycles which is only
one conditon for deadlock to exist.
And after we can check if it is realy deadlock-cycle or not

#3

If no one of methods above didn't worked, we can
use the method DETECT_AND_RECOVER (RECOVERY)
which will simply kill proccesses are in deadlock.
